🚀 **Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering**

I recently completed a machine learning project focused on understanding customer behavior through data-driven segmentation.

🧩 **Objective:**
To segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using **K-Means clustering**.

🧠 **Process Overview:**

* Cleaned and explored the Mall Customers dataset (200 records, 5 features).
* Focused on key features: *Annual Income (k$)* and *Spending Score (1–100)*.
* Applied **K-Means** and determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
* Visualized the resulting clusters in 2D to better interpret customer groups.

📊 **Results:**
The model identified **5 distinct customer segments**, including:

* 💎 High-income, high-spending — *Premium Customers*
* 💼 High-income, low-spending — *Conservative Buyers*
* 🛒 Moderate-income, high-spending — *Potential Loyalists*
* 🎯 Low-income, high-spending — *Impulsive Buyers*
* 🧍 Low-income, low-spending — *Practical Shoppers*

✨ **Key Insights:**

* Visual clustering helps understand spending patterns and guide marketing strategies.
* Data-driven segmentation enables businesses to improve customer targeting and satisfaction.
